You did nothing to me You didn't take anything from me This is my life that continues Beyond everything, beyond people
You did nothing to me You didn't gain anything Because there's more Than your pointless wars Your pointless wars
Skyscrapers and subways fall The walls of conflict raised for bread But against every terror that obstructs the path The world stands up again with the smile of a child With the smile of a child With the smile of a child

Some people cross themselves, some pray on rugs Churches and mosques, imams and all the priests Separate entrances to the same house Billions of people hoping for something
Arms without hands, faces without names Let's swap our skins, we're all human in the end Because our lives are not a point of view And a pacifist bomb doesn't exist
You did nothing to me You didn't take anything from me This is my life that continues Beyond everything, beyond people
You did nothing to me You didn't gain anything Because there's more Than your pointless wars Your pointless wars
Skyscrapers and subways fall The walls of conflict raised for bread But against every terror that obstructs the path The world stands up again with the smile of a child With the smile of a child With the smile of a child
You did nothing to me You didn't gain anything Because there's more Than your pointless wars
You did nothing to me Your pointless wars You didn't take anything from me Your pointless wars You did nothing to me Your pointless wars You didn't gain anything Your pointless wars

concerto la gente si diverte qualcuno canta forte qualcuno grida a morte  a londra piove sempre ma oggi non fa male il cielo non fa sconti neanche a un funerale a nizza il mare è rosso di fuochi e di vergogna di gente sullasfalto e sangue nella fogna  e questo corpo enorme che noi chiamiamo terra ferito nei suoi organi dallasia allinghilterra galassie di persone disperse nello spazio ma quello più importante è lo spazio di un abbraccio  di madri senza figli di figli senza padri di volti illuminati come muri senza quadri minuti di silenzio spezzati da una voce non mi avete fatto niente  non mi avete fatto niente non mi avete tolto niente questa è la mia vita che va avanti oltre tutto oltre la gente  non mi avete fatto niente non avete avuto niente perché tutto va oltre le vostre inutili guerre  cè chi si fa la croce chi prega sui tappeti le chiese e le moschee gli imam e tutti i preti ingressi separati della stessa casa miliardi di persone che sperano in qualcosa  braccia senza mani facce senza nomi scambiamoci la pelle in fondo siamo umani perché la nostra vita non è un punto di vista e non esiste bomba pacifista  non mi avete fatto niente non mi avete tolto niente questa è la mia vita che va avanti oltre tutto oltre la gente  non mi avete fatto niente non avete avuto niente perché tutto va oltre le vostre inutili guerre le vostre inutili guerre  cadranno i grattacieli le metropolitane i muri di contrasto alzati per il pane ma contro ogni terrore che ostacola il cammino il mondo si rialza col sorriso di un bambino col sorriso di un bambino col sorriso di un bambino  non mi avete fatto niente non avete avuto niente perché tutto va oltre le vostre inutili guerre  non mi avete fatto niente le vostre inutili guerre non mi avete tolto niente le vostre inutili guerre non mi avete fatto niente le vostre inutili guerre non avete avuto niente le vostre inutili guerre  sono consapevole che tutto più non torna la felicità volava come vola via una bolla,"['a', 'il',

So baby bye bye Wish you the best But most of all I wish that I could love you less
Well maybe you're right I'll find someone else You say it isn't me but when did that ever help
Hold me closer Although you'll leave before the sunrise Might be bleeding, but don't you mind, I'll be fine Oh it kills me I found the right one at the wrong time But until the sunrise Hold tight Hold tight
Maybe it happened too fast I guess that I understand You say that you've never felt this way for anyone And that's why it scares you to death
So baby bye bye Know it's for the best Still I can't see how that would ease the pain in my chest
Hold me closer Although you'll leave before the sunrise I'll be bleeding but don't you mind I'll be fine Oh it kills me I found the right one at the wrong time But until the sunrise

I think that secret is the deep hydration As they say One's skin and hair reveal everything clearly For example: dark circles around eyes point out to liver issues Dark spots around lips might mean you have an enlarged spleen An enlarged spleen is not good, not pretty
Because an artist - she has to be healthy
She has to be healthy, be healthy Be healthy, be be be be healthy Be healthy, be healthy Be healthy, she has to, has to, has to
It's such fortune that The autonomic nervous system exists So I don't have to control my heartbeats Because the heart beats, it beats on its own Nice days, bright colors of the skirt on my body Of my skirt, my dog and I We are taking a walk, counting our steps The skirt goes around my leg We are taking a walk and that's it And it doesn't have to be better than that, the heart beats on its own I put my trust in it, that it beats on its own I put my trust in it, that it beats, that I breathe God give me health, God give health, God give health God give health
I don't have the health insurance
Oh, so how will they monitor me? In the name of health And care about me? In the name of health An artist is invisible. In the name of health You don't see me, it's magic. In the name of health

We're a book on the floor in an empty house Which looks like ours Coffee with lemon To fight a hangover You look like a blurry photo And we screwed up one more night Outside a club And thank goodness
If this is the last song And then the moon will explode I'll be there to tell you you're wrong, you're wrong and you know it The music doesn't make it here I know that you don't sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep ever How two lives keep turning
We're the only ones awake in the whole universe Shouting out a bit of our anger on a rooftop That no one feels this way That no one watches movies anymore The flowers in your room My metallic top
We're a book on the floor in an empty house Which looks like ours Lost among people So many words Without ever an answer And we screwed up one more night Outside a club And thank goodness
If this is the last song And then the moon will explode I'll be there to tell you you're wrong, you're wrong and you know it The music doesn't make it here And you don't sleep And where will you be? Where are you going? When life then goes too far All the running, the fighting, the mistakes you make When something upsets you I know that you're not sleeping
Turn off the light even if you don't feel like it We stay in the dark, wrapped up Only in the sound of the voice Beyond the madness that dances in all things Two lives, look what a mess If this is the last song (And then the moon will explode) I'll be there to tell you you're wrong, you're wrong and you know it The music doesn't make it here I know thаt you don't sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep ever

If this is the last song And then the moon will explode I'll be there to tell you you're wrong, you're wrong and you know it The music doesn't make it here I know that you don't sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep ever How two lives keep turning
We're the only ones awake in the whole universe Shouting out a bit of our anger on a rooftop That no one feels this way That no one watches movies anymore The flowers in your room My metallic top
We're a book on the floor in an empty house Which looks like ours Lost among people So many words Without ever an answer And we screwed up one more night Outside a club And thank goodness
If this is the last song And then the moon will explode I'll be there to tell you you're wrong, you're wrong and you know it The music doesn't make it here And you don't sleep And where will you be? Where are you going? When life then goes too far All the running, the fighting, the mistakes you make When something upsets you I know that you're not sleeping
Turn off the light even if you don't feel like it We stay in the dark, wrapped up Only in the sound of the voice Beyond the madness that dances in all things Two lives, look what a mess If this is the last song (And then the moon will explode) I'll be there to tell you you're wrong, you're wrong and you know it The music doesn't make it here I know thаt you don't sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep ever
How two liveѕ keep turning",0,0,italian,due vite  siamo i soli svegli in tutto luniverso e non conosco ancora bene il tuo deserto forse è in un posto del mio cuore dove il sole è sempre spento dove a volte ti perdo ma se voglio ti prendo  siamo un libro sul pavimento in una casa vuota che sembra la nostra il caffè col limone contro lhangover sembri una foto mossa e ci siamo fottuti ancora una notte fuori un locale e meno male  se questa è lultima canzone e poi la luna esploderà sarò lì a dirti che sbagli ti sbagli e lo sai qui non arriva la musica tanto lo so che tu non dormi dormi dormi dormi dormi mai che giri fanno due vite  siamo i soli svegli in tutto luniverso a gridare un po di rabbia sopra un tetto che nessuno si sente così che nessuno li guarda più i film i fiori nella tua camera la mia maglia metallica  siamo un libro sul pavimento in una casa vuota che sembra la nostra persi tra le persone quante parole senza mai una risposta e ci siamo fottuti ancora una notte fuori un locale e meno male  se questa è lultima canzone e poi la luna esploderà sarò lì a dirti che sbagli ti sbagli e lo sai qui non arriva la musica e tu non dormi e dove sarai dove vai quando la vita poi esagera tutte le corse e gli schiaffi gli sbagli che fai quando qualcosa ti agita tanto lo so che tu non dormi  spegni la luce anche se non ti va restiamo al buio avvolti solo dal suono della voce al di là della follia che balla in tutte le cose due vite guarda che disordine se questa è lultima canzone e poi la luna esploderà canzone sarò lì a dirti che sbagli ti sbagli e lo sai qui non arriva la musica tanto lo ѕo che tu non dormi dormi dormi dormi dormi mai  che giri fаnno due vite,"['due', 'vite', 'siamo', 'i', 'soli', 'svegli', 'in', 'tutto', 'luniverso', 'e', 'non', 'conosco',

E mi hanno detto che la vita è preziosa Io la indosso a testa alta sul collo La mia collana non ha perle di saggezza A me hanno dato le perline colorate Per le bimbe incasinate con i traumi Da snodare piano piano con l'età Eppure sto una Pasqua guarda zero drammi Quasi quasi cambio di nuovo città Che a stare ferma a me mi viene A me mi viene
La noia La noia La noia La noia
Muoio senza morire In questi giorni usati Vivo senza soffrire Non c'è croce più grande Non ci resta che ridere in queste notti bruciate Una corona di spine sarà il dress-code per la mia festa
È la cumbia* della noia È la cumbia della noia Total Ah, è la cumbia della noia La cumbia della noia Total
Quanta gente nelle cose vede il male Viene voglia di scappare come iniziano a parlare E vorrei dirgli che sto bene ma poi mi guardano male Allora dico che è difficile campare Business parli di business Intanto chiudo gli occhi per firmare i contratti Princess ti chiama princess Allora adesso smettila di lavare i piatti
Muoio senza morire In questi giorni usati Vivo senza soffrire Non c'è croce più grande Non ci resta che ridere in queste notti bruciate Una corona di spine sarà il dress-code per la mia festa

Allora scrivi canzoni? Si, le canzoni d'amore E non ti voglio annoiare Ma qualcuno le deve cantare Cumbia, ballo la cumbia Se rischio di inciampare almeno fermo la noia Quindi faccio una festa, faccio una festa Perché è l'unico modo per fermare Per fermare Per fermare, ah
La noia La noia La noia La noia
Muoio perché morire Rende i giorni più umani Vivo perché soffrire Fa le gioie più grandi Non ci resta che ridere in queste notti bruciate Una corona di spine Sarà il dress-code per la mia feѕta

I am You are Veronikа Only she knowѕ your truth","I hid in the river and went into the silent night With loud steps, voiceless cries for help Now that I am just water In the waves, I seek peace I drown in myself, I surrender to the light
Find me, wound me, protect me Who do you chase when you leave me? Lift me up, let me go, love me Who hunts you when you fear me?
Who are you afraid of when you deny your desires? You look me in the eyes, the image of you shines in them I am a frameless mirror Just a reflection of your fears
Find me, wound me, protect me Who do you chase when you leave me? Lift me up, let me go, love me (Who hunts you when you fear me?)
