Come and wake me from this lonely place All I want is you If you take me to the stars and back I will know my dream is true
I will fly tonight, forever keep you in my heart Make it feel so right when you love me by sweet Candlelight, hold me till the morning shine All my fears subside when I look into your eyes
So step inside and place your hand into mine What you are is a blessing to my life
Well, my lord, please be with me now Send him to me It doesn't matter for how long But it is so good waiting for him
I will fly tonight, forever keep you in my heart Make it feel so right when you love me by sweet Candlelight, hold me till the morning shine All my feаrs subside when I look into your eyes

Mother Teresa and Diva Maria are with us Barefoot, as if on a blade, they walked on the ground With us mama Teresa, Diva Maria All the Divas were born as human beings
Even when we were little, we searched for a path And life is a loop, as if for those who are falling On her shoulders, still a young girl She carries a burden of pain, seeing it as a flaw Again not as she should be, or too tender Clothes on her bones, naked or going down the aisle Where is your child? What is your life? But the years are flying! You should be aware: the end is near And may someone want us to break May there be energy in you Not the elbow-deep, but the finger-deep And may someone hide hatred And envy behind a smile When you let anger into your heart Instead of kindness and love But there are saints in the sky Their feet have seen this earth, you know That's why your thorny Path is not in vain And though it may be very scary and dark And sometimes not easy But you'll always have your ancestors Following you from heaven

E mi hanno detto che la vita è preziosa Io la indosso a testa alta sul collo La mia collana non ha perle di saggezza A me hanno dato le perline colorate Per le bimbe incasinate con i traumi Da snodare piano piano con l'età Eppure sto una Pasqua guarda zero drammi Quasi quasi cambio di nuovo città Che a stare ferma a me mi viene A me mi viene

What the hell just happened? What the hell just happened? No clue, but l liked it
(One, two, one, two, three)
Broke a heel, lost my keys, scraped my knee When I fell from the chandelier Oh, what a night, I don't mind, it was time To unwind and I volunteered Look at me now I'm like usually keep it clean Beauty sleep, sip my tea
What the hell just happened? What the hell just happened? Went up on the roof, jumped into the pool You should do it too, too, too, too What the hell just happened? No clue, but l liked it
Ripped my dress, called my ex, I confess I'm obsessed, not the best idea I'm a mess, it's a trend, in my defence It's been a real hard year Freedom, I wanna shave my head Freedom, paint the whole town red Freedom, I wanna kiss a stranger
What the hell just happened? What the hell just happened?
What the hell just happened? What the hell just happened? Went up on the roof, jumped into the pool You should do it too, too, too, too I know that I'm a wreck, what did you expect? You can blame my e-e-ex What the hell juѕt hаppened? No clue, but l liked it""",,"""Someone lost a shoe I'm still in last night's makeup I'm waking up like, ""What's this new tattoo?""
